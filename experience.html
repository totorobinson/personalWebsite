                                <strong>University of Utah 2018-2022</strong><br/>
                                In my time studying computer engineering in college, I completed coursework in several programming languages such as C++, Python, and Java. Through this, I gained extensive experience with software development tools and frameworks, including Git, Visual Studio, and Agile methodologies in both Linux and Windows environments. Collaborating with teams on numerous software development projects allowed me to acquire hands-on experience in all significant facets of software engineering, from design to coding, testing, and debugging. One of my most notable achievements was conceptualizing, designing, and executing a senior capstone project with a team that involved building a mobile app, an embedded system, and utilizing AWS. The project was a testament to my technical skills and showed my ability to collaborate and innovate in a team environment.

                            <strong>Raytheon Technologies --- 2022</strong><br/>

                            As a member of the development team, I was responsible for a range of tasks to ensure the quality and functionality of the company's products. One of my main responsibilities was troubleshooting known issues and implementing a variety of bug fixes. This involved using my technical skills and expertise to identify the root cause of the problems and developing solutions to resolve them. In addition to this, I also worked on delivering user interface design solutions that were put into production to meet the needs of our users. This involved collaborating closely with other teams and stakeholders to understand the requirements and translate them into effective design solutions that could be implemented. Finally, as a team player, I made sure to document, test, and verify other team members' software. This helped to ensure that our products were thoroughly tested and met the necessary quality standards. By taking on these tasks, I contributed to the overall success of the development team and helped to deliver products that met the needs of our users.</p>

                            <strong>Raytheon Technologies --- 2021</strong><br/>
                            As a hardware engineer working with FPGAs, I had the opportunity to design, simulate, and test various hardware modules for a Xilinx FPGA on a high-performance custom signal processing board. One of the modules I developed was specifically designed to read from and write to multigigabit STM-64 signals, which required a deep understanding of the technical specifications and signal processing techniques. Throughout the project, I provided weekly updates on my progress and findings in meetings with my team members and supervisors. This ensured that everyone was aware of any issues or challenges that arose during the design and testing phases, and allowed us to collaborate more effectively to resolve them. Finally, I gave a final project presentation to share my work with the broader team and stakeholders. This presentation highlighted the key features of the FPGA hardware modules that I designed and tested, and demonstrated how they met the project requirements. Overall, my experience as a hardware engineer working with FPGAs allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the complexities involved in designing high-performance signal processing systems, and to apply my technical skills to deliver successful projects.</p>

                            <strong>University of Utah --- 2020-2021</strong><br/>
                            During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to engage in full-time, funded research focused on the analysis of antenna optimization for a Massive MIMO system. Through this experience, I gained proficiency in using CST CAD software to design and simulate antennas, which helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in antenna design and optimization. In addition to technical skills related to antenna design and optimization, I also gained valuable experience in electromagnetics and scientific computing using MATLAB. These skills were crucial in allowing me to effectively analyze and interpret the data generated through our research. Overall, my experience as an undergraduate researcher working on Massive MIMO allowed me to gain a broad range of technical skills and develop a deep understanding of the complex systems and processes involved in wireless communication. These skills will be valuable assets in any future endeavors in the field.</p>
